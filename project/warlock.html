    <img class= "warlockimg" src="./images/warlockHome.jpg" alt="warlock">
    <p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a
        magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p>
    <p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic 
        patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p>
    <p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed 
        tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p>
    <p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through 
        pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both 
        subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, 
        devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to
        bolster their own power.</p>
    <p>Warlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push at the edge of our understanding of the 
        world, always seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign 
        of danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost.</p>
    <p>Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a 
        warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a 
        demonstration of bravery. Warlocks are defined by two elements that work in concert to forge 
        their path into this class. The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a 
        warlock's entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity 
        a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god's ethos, a 
        warlock might have no love for a patron, or vice versa.</p>
    <h3>Sworn and Beholden</h3>
    <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between 
        warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons 
        for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, 
        or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the
        arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows 
        in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.</p>
    <p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being 
        (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. 
        Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. 
        They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p>
    <h3>Delvers into Secrets</h3>
    <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their 
        pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later 
        careers as well.</p>
    <p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons 
        that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, 
        meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And 
        sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is 
        opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p>
    <p>Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study 
        and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use 
        the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit 
        of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their 
        patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p>
    <h2>Creating a Warlock</h2>
    <p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations 
        that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with 
        your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would 
        allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your 
        patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in 
        anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p>
    <p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring 
        career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of 
        small favors you can do between adventures.</p>
    <p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or 
        romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your 
        patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p>
    <p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak 
        with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled 
        among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks 
        converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p>
    <h3>Patron's Attitude</h3>
    <p>Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks and their patrons it's not 
        necessarily true that both sides of the street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The 
        feeling that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative, might be 
        reciprocated by the patron, or the two participants in the pact might view one another with 
        opposing emotions.</p>
    <p>When you determine the attitude your warlock character holds toward your patron, also consider how 
        things look from the patron's perspective. How does your patron behave toward you? Is your patron 
        a friend and ally, or a n enemy that grants you power only because you forced a pact upon it?</p>
    <h4>Attitudes</h4>
    <table class="attitudes">

        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Special Terms of the Pact</h3>
    <p>A pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal contract with lengthy, detailed clauses and 
        lists of requirements. The terms of a pact- what a warlock must do to receive a patron's favor- 
        are always dictated by the patron. On occasion, those terms include a special proviso that might 
        seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks take these dictates as seriously as they do the other 
        requirements of their pacts.</p>
    <p>Does your character have a pact that requires you to change your behavior in an unusual or 
        seemingly frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn't imposed such a duty on you already, that's 
        not to say it couldn't still happen.</p>
    <h4>Special Terms</h4>
    <table class="terms">
        <tr>

        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Your pact tests your willpower; you are required to abstain from alcohol and other 
                intoxicants.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>At least once a day, you must inscribe or carve your patron's name or symbol on the wall 
                of a building.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>You must occasionally conduct bizarre rituals to maintain your pact.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>You can never wear the same outfit twice, since your patron finds such predictability to 
                be boring.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>When you use an eldritch invocation, you must speak your patron's name aloud or risk 
                incurring its displeasure.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Binding Mark</h3>
    <p>Some patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, marking the warlocks under their sway in some 
        fashion. A binding mark makes it clear- to those who know about such things- that the individual 
        in question is bound to the patron's service. A warlock might take advantage of such a mark, 
        claiming it as proof of one's pact, or might want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid 
        the difficulties it might bring.</p>
    <p>If your warlock's pact comes with a binding mark, how you feel about displaying it probably 
        depends on the nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to you. Is the mark a source 
        of pride or something you are secretly ashamed of?</p>

    <h3>Otherworldly Patron</h3>
    <p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice, as listed in 
        the link below. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th 
        level.</p>
    <a href="./patrons.html">Click here for descriptions of the patrons and their gifts!</a>
    <h3>Pact Magic</h3>
    <p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with 
        spells. See the <a href="#">Spells page</a> for the warlock spell list.</p>
    <h4>Cantrips</h4>
    <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock 
        cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock 
        table.</p>    
    <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
    <p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 
        5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the 
        same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell 
        slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level 
        spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
    <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
    <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
    <p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your 
        choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown 
        in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a 
        new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
    <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you 
        know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level 
        for which you have spell slots.</p>
    <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
    <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a 
        spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting 
        the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
    <section class="spell_mods">
    <p><i>Spell save DC</i> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <p><i>Spell attack modifier</i>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    </section>
    <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
    <p>You can use an arcane focus from the <a href="#">Items page</a> as a spellcasting focus for your 
        warlock spells.</p>
    <h3>Eldritch Invocations</h3>
    <p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden 
        knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. A level prerequisite refers to your 
        level in this class.</p>
    <p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are 
        detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain 
        additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock 
        table.</p>
    <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know 
        and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>
    <p>If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the 
        invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your 
        level in this class.</p>

    <h3>Pact Boon</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain 
        one of the following features of your choice.</p>
    <a href="./pacts.html">Click here for descriptions of the pacts!</a>
    <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
    <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one 
        ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As 
        normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
    <p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice 
        instead.</p>
    <h3>Mystic Arcanum</h3>
    <p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 
        6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>
    <p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest 
        before you can do so again.</p>
    <p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 
        7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th 
        level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>
    <h3>Eldritch Master</h3>
    <p>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron 
        to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain 
        all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this 
        feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
