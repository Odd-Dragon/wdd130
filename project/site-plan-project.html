      <h3>The Warlock</h3>
      <p>
(Here there will be a link to the less... mechanical warlock choices, such as how they interact with their patron for roleplay purposes.)
With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a
young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a
magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the
palace sentinel to his will.
As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human
whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her
spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd
alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the
mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.
Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the
fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious
beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects
both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities
of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to
bolster their own power.
Warlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push at the
edge of our understanding of the world, always seeking to expand
their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of
danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless
of the cost.
Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and
recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that
combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a
demonstration of bravery. Warlocks are defined by two elements
that work in concert to forge their path into this class. The first
element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock's
entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the
nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who
typically embrace a deity and that god's ethos, a warlock might
have no love for a patron, or vice versa.
Sworn and Beholden
A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being.
Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like
that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons
for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated
to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings
not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the
arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice.
The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional
services performed on the patron’s behalf.
The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but
lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to
see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful
spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic
with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable
in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.
Delvers into Secrets
Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and
power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their
lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their
later careers as well.

Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely
known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish.
Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful
tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without
being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes
of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened
to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that
dwell in the outer void.
Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and
power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one
makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend
to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of
warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which
typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the
demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.
Creating a Warlock
As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking
about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon
you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make
contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a
devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make
contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron,
or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the
obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the
rewards promised to you?
Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will
play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s
demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist
entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.
What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it
friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does
your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your
patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?
How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a
familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice.
Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees,
mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages
that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their
patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with
intermediaries.
Patron's Attitude
Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks
and their patrons it's not necessarily true that both sides of the
street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The feeling
that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative,
might be reciprocated by the patron, or the two participants in the
pact might view one another with opposing emotions.
When you determine the attitude your warlock character holds
toward your patron, also consider how things look from the
patron's perspective. How does your patron behave toward you?
Is your patron a friend and ally, or a n enemy that grants yo u
power only because you forced a pact upon it?
Patron Attitudes
d6 Attitude
1 Your patron has guided and helped your family for
generations and is kindly toward you.
2 Each interaction with your capricious patron is a surprise,
whether pleasant or painful.
3
Your patron is the spirit of a long-dead hero who sees
your pact as a way for it to continue to influence the
world.
4 Your patron is a strict disciplinarian but treats you with a
measure of respect.
5 Your patron tricked yo u into a pact and treats you as a
slave.
6
You are mostly left to your own devices with no
interference from your patron. Sometimes you dread the
demands it will make when it does appear.
Special Terms of the Pact
A pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal contract with
lengthy, detailed clauses and lists of requirements. The terms of a
pact- what a warlock must do to receive a patron's favor- are
always dictated by the patron. On occasion, those terms include a
special proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks
take these dictates as seriously as they do the other requirements
of their pacts.
Does your character have a pact that requires you to change
your behavior in an unusual or seemingly frivolous way? Even if
your patron hasn't imposed such a duty on you already, that's not
to say it couldn't still happen.
Special Terms
d6 Term
1 When directed, you must take immediate action against a
specific enemy of your patron.
2 Your pact tests your willpower; you are required to
abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants.
3 At least once a day, you must inscribe or carve your
patron's name or symbol on the wall of a building.
4 You must occasionally conduct bizarre rituals to maintain
your pact.
5 You can never wear the same outfit twice, since your
patron finds such predictability to be boring.
6 When you use an eldritch invocation, you must speak
your patron's name aloud or risk incurring its displeasure.
Binding Mark
Some patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, marking the
warlocks under their sway in some fashion. A binding mark
makes it clear- to those who know about such things- that the
individual in question is bound to the patron's service. A warlock
might take advantage of such a mark, claiming it as proof of one's
pact, or might want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid
the difficulties it might bring.

If your warlock's pact comes with a binding mark, how you feel
about displaying it probably depends on the nature of your
relationship with the one who gave it to you. Is the mark a source
of pride or something you are secretly ashamed of?
Binding Marks
d6 Mark
1 One of your eyes looks the same as one of your patron's
eyes.
2 Each time you wake up, the small blemish on your face
appears in a different place.
3 You display outward symptoms of a disease but suffer no
ill effects from it.
4 Your tongue is an unnatural color.
5 You have a vestigial tail.
6 Your nose glows in the dark.
Quick Build
You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions.
First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by
Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third,
choose the Eldritch Blast and Chill Touch cantrips, along with the
1st-level spells Charm Person and Witch Bolt.
Class Features
As a warlock, you gain the following class features.
Hit Points
Hit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution
modifier per warlock level after 1st
Proficiencies
Armor: Light armor
Weapons: Simple weapons
Tools: None
Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma
Skills: Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History,
Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion
Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the
equipment granted by your background:
(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
(a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack
Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers
Otherworldly Patron
At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being
of your choice: the Fiend, which is detailed at the end of the class
description, or one from another source. Your choice grants you
features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
Pact Magic
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your
patron have given you facility with spells. See Spells Rules for
the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the
warlock spell list.
Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list.
You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher
levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock
table.
Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows
what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same
level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher,
you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a short or long rest.
For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level
spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend
one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
Spells Known of 1st Level and
Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from
the warlock spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when
you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and
higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than
what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level.
When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock
spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with
another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a
level for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so
you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
Charisma modifier
Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section)
as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.
(Here there will eventually be links to two sub-pages that contain the pact boon and eldritch invocation options.)
Eldritch Invocations
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch
invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you
with an abiding magical ability. A level prerequisite refers to your
level in this class.
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice.
Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class
description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain
additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations
Known column of the Warlock table.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with
another invocation that you could learn at that level.
If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them
to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you
meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in
this class.
Agonizing Blast
Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip
When you cast Eldritch Blast, add your Charisma modifier to
the damage it deals on a hit.
Arcane Gunslinger
Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature

weapon.

a spell slot or material components.
Ascendant Step
Prerequisite: 9th level
You can cast Levitate on yourself at will, without expending a

Book of Ancient Secrets
Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature
You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of
Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from
any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The
spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of
spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can
cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as
rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can
also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual
tag.
On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your
Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to
the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your
warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to
transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription
process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to
inscribe it.
Burning Hex
Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron
As a bonus action, you cause a target cursed by your
Hexblade’s Curse to take fire damage equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1).
Caiphon’s Beacon
Prerequisite: The Great Old One patron

charmed creatures.
Chains of Carceri
Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature

Chronicle of the Raven Queen
Prerequisite: Raven Queen patron, Pact of the Tome feature
You can place a corpse’s hand or similar appendage on your

ability within 1 minute of a creature’s death, and a given creature
can only be asked one question in this manner.
Claw of Acamar
Prerequisite: The Great Old One patron, Pact of the Blade
feature
You can create a black, lead flail using your Pact of the Blade
feature. The flail’s head is sculpted to resemble a pair of grasping
tentacles. The weapon has the reach property. When you hit a
creature with it, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional
2d8 necrotic damage to the target per spell level, and you can
reduce the creature’s speed to 0 feet until the end of your next
turn.
Cloak of Baalzebul
Prerequisite: The Fiend patron
As a bonus action, you can conjure a swarm of buzzing flies
around you. The swarm grants you advantage on Intimidation

poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier. You can dismiss
the swarm with another bonus action.
Cloak of Flies
Prerequisite: 5th level
As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical
aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from
you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until
you're incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action.
Contagious Touch
Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Blade feature
You can cast Contagion once using a warlock spell slot. You
can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
Curse Bringer
Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron, Pact of the Blade feature
You can create a greatsword forged from silver, with black
runes etched into its blade, using your Pact of the Blade feature. If
you reduce a target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse to 0 hit
points with this sword, you can immediately change the target of
the curse to a different creature. This change doesn’t extend the
curse’s duration. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you
can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 slashing damage
to the target per spell level, and you can reduce the creature’s
speed to 0 feet until the end of your next turn.
Devil’s Sight
You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical,
to a distance of 120 feet.

Dreadful Word
Prerequisite: 7th level

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon,

damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot,
and you can knock the target prone if it is Huge or smaller.
Eldritch Spear
Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip
When you cast Eldritch Blast, its range is 300 feet.
Eyes of the Rune Keeper
You can read all writing.
Fiendish Vigor
You can cast False Life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell,
without expending a spell slot or material components.
Frost Lance
Prerequisite: The Archfey patron, Eldritch Blast cantrip
You draw on the gifts of the Prince of Frost to trap your
enemies in ice. When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Blast
cantrip one or more times on your turn, you can reduce that
creature’s speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.
Gaze of Khirad
Prerequisite: 7th level, the Great Old One patron You gain the
piercing gaze of the blue star Khirad. As an action, you can see
through solid objects to a range of 30 feet until the end of the
current turn. During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly,
transparent images.
Gaze of Two Minds
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive
through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the
creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use
your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection,
extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While
perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from
any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded
and deafened to your own surroundings.
Ghostly Gaze
Prerequisite: 7th level
As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to
a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you
don’t already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until
your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent
images.
Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
Gift of the Depths
Prerequisite: 5th level
You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed
equal to your walking speed.
You can also cast Water Breathing without expending a spell
slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
Gift of the Ever-Living Ones
Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature
Whenever you regain hit points while your familiar is within
100 feet of you, treat any dice rolled to determine the hit points
you regain as having rolled their maximum value for you.
Grasp of Hadar
Prerequisite: Eldritch Blast cantrip
Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your
Eldritch Blast, you can move that creature in a straight line 10
feet closer to yourself.
Green Lord’s Gift
Prerequisite: The Archfey patron
The Green Lord oversees a verdant realm of everlasting
summer. Your soul is linked to his power. Whenever you regain
hit points, you treat any dice rolled to determine the hit points you
regain as having rolled their maximum value.
Improved Pact Weapon
Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade feature
You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the
Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.
In addition, the weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and
damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus
to those rolls.
Finally, the weapon you conjure can be a shortbow, longbow,

Pact Boon
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you
for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of
your choice.
Pact of The Aegis
You can use your action to create a pact shield in your empty
hand or pact armor equipped on your person. You can choose the
form that this aegis takes, up to medium armor. You are proficient
with it while you wield it. If you create a shield, you can use
somatic components while using it.
Your pact aegis disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from
you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature
again, if you dismiss the aegis (no action required), or if you die.
You can transform one magic shield OR one magic suit of
armor into your pact aegis by performing a special ritual while
you hold it. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour,
which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the
aegis, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears
whenever you create your pact aegis thereafter. You can’t affect
an artifact or a sentient item in this way. The shield or armor
ceases being your pact aegis if you die, if you perform the 1-hour
ritual on a different item, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break
your bond to it. The aegis appears at your feet if it is in the
extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
Pact of The Beast
You can use your action to shapeshift into one beast of CR 1 or
lower. This beast, once chosen, is the same each time you use this
feature. If the creature has a swimming speed, you do not gain
that particular feature until 4th level, and if it has a flying speed,
you do not gain that particular feature until 8th level. When you
shapeshift, it lasts for one hour or until you drop to 0 HP in that
form, at which point you revert back to yourself. Once you use
this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or
long rest.
Pact of the Blade
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty
hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each
time you create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options).
You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts
as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from
you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature
again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you
die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon
by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You
perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done
during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it
into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you
create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or
a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact
weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different
weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The
weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space
when the bond breaks.
Pact of the Chain
You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.
When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal
forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms:
imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo
one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack
with its reaction.
Pact of The Charm
You have 1 luck point. Whenever you make an attack roll, ability
check, or saving throw, you may spend 1 luck point to roll an
additional d20. You can use this ability after the original roll, but
before the outcome is revealed. You choose which of the d20s is
used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.
You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made
against you. Roll a d20, and choose whether the attacker's roll
uses their d20 roll or yours. If multiple creatures use a luck point
on the same roll, they cancel out, resulting in no additional dice.
You regain your luck point when you finish a long rest.
Pact of The Claw
One of your hands turns into a claw of pure magical energy. This
claw can act as your arcane focus. It can be used for a magical
unarmed strike, which uses your Charisma modifier for its attack
and damage rolls. The claw deals 1d6 damage of your choice of
slashing or piercing. This claw can also extend up to 10 feet.
Through this feature, you can use your attack to cast any spell,
invocation, or patron ability with a range of 5 feet or touch at any
creature within 10 feet of you, and you can add the claw's damage
to those effects.
Pact of The Deck
You gain a magic deck of cards from your patron. After a long
rest, you may draw one card, gaining the benefit granted by the
card until the beginning of your next long rest.

suffer ill effects from heat or cold. You also gain the Rustic

during one of your short rests. After this has been used, it cannot
be used again until this card is drawn again.

Pact of The Eidolon
Your spells are cast by an avatar of your patron. When you cast a
spell that matches your patron’s dogma (as determined by you
and your DM) the critical range for the attack becomes 19-20.
Your spells no longer require verbal or somatic components,
though you still need materials or an arcane focus.
Pact of The Geas
Your patron gifts you the ability to influence others’ thoughts and
actions. You gain a number of Geas uses equal to your Charisma
modifier. You may expend one of the uses to cast Command as a
1st level spell. When you do so, you may expend an additional
use to enhance it with one of the following:
You cast the spell with a bonus action, instead of a regular
action.
You impose disadvantage on the save.
You cast it at your spellcasting level. (If you are a level 3
Warlock for instance, you can cast it as a 2nd level, spell, as
you have slots of that level.) Starting at 9th level, this
enhancement also allows you to replace Command with
Geas if you so choose.
You regain one expended use of Geas after a short rest, and all
your expended uses after a long rest.
Pact of the Looter
You earned your pact not by making a deal, but by offending a
being with great power. In order to make up your debt, you are
expected to serve this being, and gain the following benefits and
detriments to aid you in your servitude.
You have one valuable trinket that once belonged to your
patron, and is your pact item. It must be worth 50 gold or
more, such as a piece of jewelry or a fancy set of tools.
While this item is not in your possession, you lose all
benefits of this pact, but keep the detriments. This item
can be used as a spellcasting focus.
You have advantage on Death Saving Throws.
You must actively pursue other warlocks of the same pact
to kill them and/or retrieve their trinket.
Once per long rest while the item is in your possession,
you can cast Commune without expending a spell slot.
You may choose one skill to gain advantage on checks for.
This becomes disadvantage if you lose your trinket.
Pact of The Lord
You gain the service of a humanoid creature compelled to serve
you by your patron. Choose the Spy, Evil Mage, or Feathergale
Knight. Their alignment matches yours, and they use your action
economy to attack but otherwise act on their own and have their
own initiative. You can deliver touch spells through them as well.
Pact of The Morning Star
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in the form of a
whip in your empty hand. You are proficient with it while you
wield it. Your pact whip has a reach of 10 feet, counts as a finesse
weapon, and deals 1d6 magical slashing damage for purposes of
overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
damage.
The whip is capable of extending up to 60 feet for utility
purposes. Such purposes might include wrapping around/ pulling
objects straight toward you that are not worn or carried, simple
manipulations such as pulling a lever, wrapping around an anchor
point you can climb to, swing from, or break a fall with, or
wrapping around another creature to break their fall. The DM sets
the DC and ability check for any task in which the whip is being
used this way, and determines- particularly in instances of fallingwhether
or not any damage is still taken. The whip disappears if it
is more than 5 feet away from you for one minute or more. It also
disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon
(no action required), or if you die.
In addition, you gain the Eldritch Whip feature below.
Eldritch Whip
You loose your whip toward a target, unleashing its otherworldly
essence as it rushes toward them. As an action, make a ranged
spell attack roll against a target that you can see within 30 feet.
On a success, you deal damage equal to your whip’s damage roll
and modifier, plus 1d4 of extra damage. All damage dealt in this
way is of a damage type associated with your patron.
At higher levels, this feature does additional damage. The 1d4
becomes 2d4 at level 5, 3d4 at level 11, and 4d4 at level 17.
Pact of The Oracle
Your patron gifts you the ability to see and know things others
cannot. You gain a number of Sight uses equal to your Charisma
modifier. You may expend one of the uses to cast one of the
following spells: Detect Magic, Detect Evil and Good, Hunter’s
Mark, and Identify.
You regain one expended use of the Sight after a short rest, and
all your expended uses after a long rest.
Pact of The Pathfinder
You can use your action to create a pair of pact boots equipped on
your person. You can choose the form that these boots or shoes
take. You are proficient with them while you wield them. While
wearing these eldritch shoes or boots, your movement speed
increases by 10 feet and you add your Charisma score to your
long jumps and Charisma modifier to your high jumps. In
addition, while wearing these boots or shoes your unarmed strikes
become 1d4 damage of your choice of piercing, slashing, or
bludgeoning.
Your pact boots disappear if they are more than 5 feet away
from you for 1 minute or more. They also disappear if you use
this feature again, if you dismiss the boots (no action required), or
if you die.
You can transform one magic pair of boots or shoes into your
pact boots by performing a special ritual while you hold it. You
perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done
during a short rest. You can then dismiss the boots, shunting them
into an extradimensional space, and they appear whenever you
create your pact boots thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a
sentient item in this way. The boots cease being your pact boots if
you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different item, or if
you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to them. The boots
appear at your feet if they are in the extradimensional space when
the bond breaks.

Pact of The Shroud
Your patron gifts you a shroud from its plane, an ancient garment
woven with otherworldly skill, to aid your efforts by concealing
your intentions and presence.
You can wear this gifted cloak with the hood up or down, and
the effects change based on how it is worn. Putting the hood up or
down takes an action, just as it does with other magical cloaks.
When the cloak’s hood is down, it appears nonmagical, as
though under the effects of Nystul’s Magic Aura. You also gain
proficiency in the Deception skill, and add an additional half your
proficiency (rounded down) to any deception check you make
while wearing the cloak.
When the hood is up, your outline becomes blurry and
displaced, granting you proficiency in the Stealth skill, and
allowing you to add an additional half your proficiency (rounded
down) to any stealth checks you make while wearing the cloak.
You also gain the benefits of half cover while in dim light or
darkness.
As an action, you can summon the cloak from its plane. When
it appears, you are wearing it and do not need to take further
action to put it on. You may also dismiss the cloak (no action
required) into its home plane. The cloak disappears if it is further
than five feet from you for one minute.
If you find a magical cloak or cape in your travels, you may
entreat your patron to imbue the properties of the shroud into the
new cloak by performing a 1- hour ritual. Upon completing the
ritual, the new cloak has the benefits of this feature, in addition to
whatever benefit it normally confers. Any cloak previously
affected in this way loses its Shroud properties upon completion
of the ritual.
Pact of the Star Chain
Prerequisite: Seeker Patron
At 3rd level, a character dedicated to the Seeker can select this
option.
The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated
with seven gleaming motes of brightness. While the chain is on
your person, you know the augury spell and can cast it as a ritual.
The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.
Additionally, you can invoke the Seeker’s power to gain
advantage on an Intelligence check while you carry this item.
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you
complete a short or long rest.
If you lose your Star Chain, you can perform a 1-hour
ceremony to receive a replacement from the Seeker. The
ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it
destroys the previous chain. The chain disappears in a flash of
light when you die.
The exact form of this item might be different depending on
your patron. The Star Chain is inspired by the Greyhawk deity
Celestian.
Pact of The Symbiote
You become physically corrupted by your patron. They will
occasionally take control of your body (as determined by your
DM), but in exchange, you gain an 18 in an ability score of your
choice.
Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows.
When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any
class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While
the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will.
They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they
don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless
warlock spells for you.
If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour
ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This
ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it
destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.
Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature
to take a feat of your choice instead.
Mystic Arcanum (6th level)
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret
called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock
spell list as this arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a
spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice
that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one
8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.
You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a
long rest.
Eldritch Master
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical
power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots.
You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain
all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once
you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest
before you can do so again.

      The Archfey (PHB)
Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who
holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were
born. This being's motivations are often inscrutable, and
sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater
magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this
sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,
ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her
consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools;
and ancient hags.
Expanded Spell List
The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.
Archfey Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Faerie Fire, Sleep
2nd Calm Emotions, Phantasmal Force
3rd Blink, Plant Growth
4th Dominate Beast, Greater Invisibility
5th Dominate Person, Seeming
Fey Presence
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to
project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an
action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating
from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock
spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all
charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your
next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.
Misty Escape
Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response
to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to
turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space
you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn
or until you attack or cast a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.
Beguiling Defenses
Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the
mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are
immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to
charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm
back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed
by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
Dark Delirium
Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory
realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60
feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your
warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or
frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your
concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell).
This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.
Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty
realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see
and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.
You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this
feature again.
The Archlich (H)
Your patron is an archlich, a particularly powerful lich that may
have been neutral or good during life. This being's motivations
include immortality, mastery of death and undeath, and the
acquisition of any kind of knowledge you or it can access.
Entutues of this type include Lady Alanthene Moonstar of
Waterdeep, Rhaudilath the Ageless, Ezzat the Archlich, Lady
Saharel, and Renwick Caradoon. In extremely specific cases,
Vecna can be patron to such warlocks as well.
Expanded Spell List
The Archlich lets you choose from an expanded spell list when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.
Archlich Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st False Life, Ray of Sickness
2nd Blindness/Deafness, Ray of Enfeeblement
3rd Animate Dead, Vampiric Touch
4th Blight, Confusion
5th Contact Other Plane, Raise Dead
Blessing of the Archlich
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to transfer life force from
your enemies to yourself. Once per turn when you kill one or
more creatures with a cantrip, you gain temporary hit points equal
to the Overkill damage dealt. You can do this a number of times
equal to your warlock level per short rest.
Control Undeath
At 6th level when you cast Animate Dead, you can target one
additional corpse or pile of bones to create an additional zombie
or skeleton. Whenever you create an undead with Animate Dead
it has these additional benefits:
The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an
amount equal to your warlock level.
The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon
damage.
If you picked the Pact of the Beast, Chain, Claw, Looter,
Lord, or Symbiote feature, you can command one of your
undead to make an extra attack once per turn.
If you picked the Pact of the Aegis, Blade, Morning Star,
Pathfinder, or Shroud feature, you can summon your pact
item in the possession of one of your undead.
If you picked the Pact of the Charm, Eidolon, Geas, Oracle,
or Tome feature, you can choose to cast touch cantrips
through one of your undead.
If you picked the Pact of the Deck feature, you can choose
to either command one of your undead to make an extra
attack once per turn or to cast touch cantrips through one
of your undead, but you make the choice when you draw
your card, and it stays that way until the next long rest.
Necrotic Resilience
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage.
Additionally, once per turn you gain the ability to heal yourself
for half the necrotic damage you take (accounting for your
resistance, this will equal a quarter of the necrotic damage
originally dealt).
Undead Commander
Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under
your control, even those summoned or created by other people.
As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within
60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw
against your warlock spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use
this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and
obeys your command until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target
has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw
at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
The Astral Dragon (H)
You've made a pact with an astral dragon, the natural residents of
the astral plane and one of the only creatures that can travel
through all existing planes at will. These dragons are highly
intelligent, and their solitary chaotic nature makes their
personality quite complex and often quirky. An astral dragon's
interests may vary, but it often has personal endeavors such as
treasure hunting, studying spells, or simply living free of any
restrictions. They are the embodiment of freedom and thought.
Expanded Spell List
The Astral Dragon lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you choose a warlock spell. The following spells are added
to the warlock spell list for you.
Astral Dragon Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Command, Shield
2nd Locate Object, See Invisibility
3rd Elemental Weapon, Protection from Energy
4th Compulsion, Fire Shield
5th Dominate Person, Hallow
Hoard Sense
Starting at 1st level, you inherently know the worth of any
treasure or valuable item you can see, and have advantage on
Investigation checks to find the location of coinage, gems, and art
items of significant worth.
Additionally, as an action you may summon or dismiss a
personal chest from your patron's hoard to or from an unoccupied
point on the ground within 5 feet of you. The chest is initially
empty, and may hold up to 6 cubic feet of non-living material (3
feet by 2 feet by 1 foot).
Astral Screech
At 6th level, you can let out an otherworldly shriek, warping the
minds of those around you. As an action on your turn, you may
expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher and use this screech,
causing all creatures within a 15-foot radius of you to make a
Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature
takes half damage on a successful save. This ability deals psychic
damage equal you 4d8 plus your Charisma modifier, plus 1d8
damage per level of the spell slot above 3rd.
Astral Mind
Starting at 10th level, your mind becomes closer to that of the
astral dragon; perfectly serene and unchangeable. It is similar to
the astral void, which can overwhelm the mind of those who
manipulate it.
You have resistance to psychic damage and advantage on
Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws. When a creature deals
psychic damage to you or attempts to charm, frighten or possess
you and fails, it must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw
against your warlock spell DC or become stunned until the start
of your next turn.
Psychic Storm
Starting at 14th level, you can use this feature as part of an attack
to tap into the astral dragon's lair powers and manifest psychic
winds around you.
You choose a number of creatures up to to your Charisma
modifier within 120 feet. Targets are pushed up to 15 feet in
directions you choose and take 3d10 psychic damage. A targeted
creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against
your warlock spell DC or be affected by the psychic wind's
mental effects, which are determined by the following table :
Psychic Storm Effects
d20 Mental Effect
1-9 The target takes 4d10 psychic damage
10-
14
The target is stunned for 1 minute; it can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each its turns to end the
effect
15-
17
The target is unconscious for 1 minute, until it takes
damage or another creature uses an action to shake it
awake
18-
20
The target gains a short-term madness effect for 5
minutes
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
complete a long rest.
The Celestial (XGE)
Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. You have
bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, unicorn, or
other entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your
pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of
the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.
Being connected to such power can cause changes in your
behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate
the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times,
your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial
realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the
rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among
mortals for now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the
dark places of the world. At the same time, you crave the light
and find total darkness a suffocating experience akin to drowning.
As an optional way to add more flavor to your character, you can
pick from or roll on the following table of quirks associated with
celestial warlocks.
Celestial Quirks
d10 Flaw
1 You are afraid of the dark, and must always have a light
source at hand.
2 You have a nervous compulsion to keep a bright light in
even the barest shadow.
3 You have a compulsion to enter and illuminate dark
areas.
4 You have an overwhelming hatred of undead creatures.
5 You fidget and are irritable when you can’t see the sun.
6 In a dark area, you always carry a lit torch or lantern.
Putting it down is an unbearable thought.
7 Your skin seems to reflect more light than normal,
making you almost glow in direct sunlight.
8 Your eyes change color at random while you're in the
sun.
9 While in the dark, you feel as if it is far colder than it
actually is.
10 Your shadow is lighter than the area around it, rather
than darker, or you have no shadow.
Expanded Spell List
The Celestial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to
the warlock spell list for you.
Celestial Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt
2nd Flaming Sphere, Lesser Restoration
3rd Daylight, Revivify
4th Guardian of Faith, Wall of Fire
5th Flame Strike, Greater Restoration
Bonus Cantrips
At 1st level, you learn the Light and Sacred Flame cantrips. They
count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don't count against
your number of cantrips known.
Healing Light
At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to
heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this
healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock
level. As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see
within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool.
The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals
your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you
spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal
to the total.
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long
rest.
Radiant Soul
Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve
as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant
damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire
damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or
fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.
Celestial Resilience
Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever
you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal
your warlock level+ your Charisma modifier. Additionally,
choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest.
Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your
warlock level + your Charisma modifier.
Searing Vengeance
Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you
to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at
the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet
with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half
your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose.
Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes
radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is
blinded until the end of the current turn.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a long rest.
The Cosmic Machine (H)
Your patron is a cosmic machine that claims to have generated,
continuously sustains, and will ultimately disassemble the
multiverse. You patron might originate from Mechanus, or it
could be hidden among the ruins and forgotten places of the
material realm. The cosmic machine's motivations and desires are
inscrutiable, even to you, its coded directions never seeming to
add up to a discernable greater plan. Your physical appearance or
mental and emotional capacity may be somewhat changed by
your relationship to the machine, and your pact spells are all
cosmetically altered to reflect the machine's technologically
advanced themes. Examples of cosmic machines are Primus, the
Engine of Extinction, and Panopticon.
Cosmic Machine Quirks
d8 Quirks
1 You are obsessed with the form and function of all
objects, particularly ones with moving parts.
2 You have an overbearing contempt for any tradition that
defies logical reasoning.
3 You find it difficult to convey subtle emotion.
4 You are irritated when a less optimal approach to a
particular issue is taken.
5 Your movements are always methodical and deliberate
unless you make an extra effort to appear natural.
6 Your face appears unnervingly perfect, similar to a
porcelain mask.
7 You often ignore social convention in the face of logic.
8
Everything must be ordered, everything must be in place.
That book should be in the shelf, that mop should be next
to the bucket...
Expanded Spell List
The Cosmic Machine lets you choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are
added to the warlock spell list for you.
Cosmic Machine Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Guiding Bolt, Identify
2nd Heat Metal, Locate Object
3rd Lightning Bolt, Spirit Guardians*
4th Arcane Eye, Stoneskin
5th Creation, Telekinesis
*Unless you learn this spell from another class, your spirit
guardians appear as mechanical constructs rather than angelic,
fey, or fiendish.
Advanced Targeting System
Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to make a
ranged spell attack against a creature within 120 feet of you. If
you hit, your spell attacks against that creature gain advantage
until the start of your next turn.
Advanced Protocol System
Starting at 6th level, your affinity with the Cosmic Machine
makes your mind incredibly resilient. You gain proficiency with
Wisdom saving throws, and advantage on saving throws agains
mind-altering effects.
Advanced Integration System
Starting at 10th level, you are granted access to a database of
sorts that gives you extraknowledge and skill. You gain
proficiency with your choice of any four tools, languages, or
skills (or combination thereof) of your choice.
Advanced Override System
Starting at 14th level, you can integrate a creature into the Cosmic
Machine's directives, overriding the creature's normal impulses
with your own will. The creature must make an Intelligence
saving throw against your Spell Save DC. Constructs have
disadvantage on this save, and creatures who are immune to
mind-altering effects must still make the save. Of the creature
fails you dictate the creature's actions on each of its turns for the
next minute. At the end of each of its turns it can make a new
saving throw to end this effect.
You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this
feature again.
The Coven (H)
You have joined a coven of witches, a group of warlocks led by
an old, powerful witch or even a lesser goddess of magic. A
coven's motives vary from group to group, and are often
determined at least in part by the individual motives of the leader.
You are likely seen as a small part of the whole, and will often be
called on or granted the ability to call on others of your coven to
help. Leaders of such covens often come in councils of three.
Such councils include Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos; the
Morrigan; the Norns; or Artemis, Demeter, and Hecate. Some
covens are led by individual witches instead, including Circe,
Morgan le Fay, or Marie Laveau. Regardless of the individual
leadership of the coven, such warlocks draw power from their
bond with others and find strength in numbers.
Expanded Spell List
The Coven lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.
Coven Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Bless, Sleep
2nd Augury, Warding Bond
3rd Conjure Animals, Plant Growth
4th Compulsion, Divination
5th Geas, Scrying
One of the Fold
Starting at 1st level, you have advantage on History and Arcana
checks, and intrinsically know where other members of your
coven are. If a member of your coven is within a mile of you, you
can telepathically communicate with them freely, but such
conversations require concentration.
Shared Pain
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to draw on the strength
of your coven to protect you- but they draw on your strength as
well. For one minute, you gain resistance to all forms of damage
except psychic and necrotic. You will gain non-damaging cuts
and bruises from time to time due to witches in your coven using
this ability, which recharges after a short or long rest.
Supreme Clarity
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to end one mindaltering
effect on yourself.
Call of the Coven
Starting at 14th level, you can call upon others in your coven to
help you out of tight spots. When you call your coven, it takes a
full action, and a number of members of your level equal to your
Charisma modifier arrive, allowing you one of the following
options for one round:
You can cast one spell of your choice from any spell list of a
level equal to your highest mystic arcanum.
Spells you cast and actions you take until the end of your
next turn have bonuses to their damage equal to your
Charisma modifier, and are treated as if you rolled a
natural 20.
Each member of your coven gains an action during your
turn that can be used to make an attack, cast a spell of 5th
level or lower, or use an object. Unless your DM says
otherwise, members of your coven have access to the same
items and spells, and use your stats to cast and attack. This
ability can be used once per long rest. At the end of each
long rest, roll 1d20. On a 1, you lose a spell slot due to
being called by the coven to assist another.
The Crone (H)
Your patron is an elder force in the world that veers capriciously
between its maternal and destructive instincts. Such creatures
smother those they hold dear with doting attention and reject
those set against them with ruthless cruelty, often oscillating
between these extremes seemingly without prompting. You have
chosen a spiteful and suffocating patron, one whose nature you
find yourself more and more mimicking.
Beings of this sort include: Aradia, mother of witchcraft, Baba
Yaga, the evil woman, and Hecate, queen of witches.
Expanded Spell List
The Crone lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.
Crone Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Animal Friendship, Bless
2nd Augury, Enhance Ability
3rd Bestow Curse, Remove Curse
4th Conjure Woodland Beings, Locate Creature
5th Contagion, Hallow
Witch’s Cackle
Starting at 1st level, you know the bane spell, and can cast it as a
1st level spell three times per long rest without expending a spell
slot. Additionally, you can channel the mad fury of the Crone to
extend the duration of your fate-twisting effects. As a bonus
action, you cackle madly. Any creature within 30 feet of you that
is under the effect of a concentration spell cast by you has the
duration of that effect extended by one round (until the end of
your next turn). Each time you cackle, targets may make a new
saving throw against any effects that are extended by this class
feature.
Blood Magic
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell you can call out to
your companions to shed blood and grant you additional power.
One ally within 30 feet of you can spend their reaction to take
1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell slot, effectively
empowering the spell. If your spell includes a spell attack roll,
you gain advantage. If the spell includes a saving throw, the target
creatures gain advantage on that roll.
Walking Hovel, Flying Broom
Starting at 10th level, you gain the ability to cast Animate Objects
and Fly. Once you cast each spell you cannot cast it again until
you complete a short or long rest.
Witch’s Transformation
Starting at 14th level, you know the Polymorph spell, and can
cast it once per long rest without expending a spell slot. Creatures
polymorphed without a spell slot become neutral toward you for
the duration, unless you do something to anger them.
The Elder Brain (H)
There are rare instances in which humanoids that have been
captured and exposed to the Illithid Thrall creation process
startled the mind flayers with great willpower and intellectual
potential, heavily resisting the attempts to turn them into a thrall.
Occasionally, rather than force the ceremony to be completed, the
mind flayers take the humanoid to the Elder Brain of the colony
for examination.
Those being that pass the examination are given a choice: Live
a short, painful life, then die as a gruesome biological experiment
or be changed and become an honorary mind flayer of the colony,
gaining newfound abilities and retaining their free will at the
expense of some of their humanity and individuality.
Those who accept the pact are magically, mentally, and
biologically altered by the Elder Brain for several days before
emerging from its pool a much stranger and more powerful being
than before. These warlocks are bound to the Elder Brain that
changed them, and are required to seek out new knowledge for
the colony, as well as to help defend it should their safety be
compromised.
Elder Brain Quirks
d6 Quirk
1 I constantly crave intelligent brains, even immediately
after eating one.
2 I show contempt to any and all creatures that I see as not
as intelligent as me, which is pretty much all creatures.
3 I refuse to engage with an enemy when I can have
someone else do it for me.
4 I tend to confuse people with livestock.
5 I am always obsessively researching a very specific topic.
6 I'm used to having my own thoughts examined

Mind Flayer Baptism
Your newfound training and bodily alterations by mind flayers
has opened your mind to newfound abilities. When you choose
this patron you may choose to use either Charisma or Intelligence
as your spellcasting modifier.
Additionally, you crave the thoughts and memories of others.
As an action you can physically devour the remaining
functionality of a creature's brain who has died in the past 10
minutes and has at least a 10 Intelligence score. You gain 1
Temporary Hit Point per use of this ability, which stacks with
other Temporary Hit Points. You cannot gain more Temporary Hit
Points than your Warlock Level + your Intelligence Modifier +
Your Proficiency Bonus with this feature.
Psychic Adept
Your mental capacities continue to grow as you learn more about
your arcane powers.
At 6th level you have resistance to psychic damage, and when
you deal psychic damage, you may re-roll the damage dice and
use the higher number.
Additionally, you can now establish psychic lings up to your
spellcasting modifier that allow you to permanently communicate
with and perceive all senses in a willing creature, so long as they
are on the same plane as you.
Lastly, you gain the ability to telepathically communicate with
any creature that knows at least one language and is within 60
feet of you.
Mind Blast
You learn one of the most powerful psionic techniques in order to
shatter the minds of your enemies.
At 10th level, you can force all enemies within a 30-foot cone
to make an Intelligence saving throw vs your Spell Save DC. On
a failed save, a creature takes 5d8+ your Spellcasting Modifier
psychic damage and is stunned for one round. You can only use
this feature once per short or long rest.
Disciple of the Elder Brain
At 14th level, you reach the peak of your mental abilities with the
help of your patron. First, you are immune to psychic damage,
and increase the psychic damage of your attacks by 1 damage die.
Second, you can use creatures that you've bonded via your
psychic links as extensions of your mind. As an action you can
select a creature that you've established a psychic link with, and
emit a psychic pulse from them. All creatures within 10 feet of
the creature must make an Intelligence saving throw vs your Spell
Save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 psychic damage.
This psychic pulse can be used a number of times equal to your
relevant spellcasting modifier per long rest.
The Fiend (PHB)
You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of
existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against
those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all
things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge
a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus,
Fraz'Urb-Iuu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus,
Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that
are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the
yugoloths.
Expanded Spell List
The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.
Fiend Expanded Spells

3rd Fireball, Stinking Cloud
4th Fire Shield, Wall of Fire
5th Flame Strike, Hallow
Dark One's Blessing
Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma
modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).
Dark One's Own Luck
Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in
your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw,
you can use this feature to add a d1O to your roll. You can do so
after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects
occur.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.
Fiendish Resilience
Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you
finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type
until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from
magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.
Hurl Through Hell
Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you
can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the
lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a
nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target
returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest
unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10
psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you
use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
The Future Self (H)
Your patron is you in a decades- distant future. Perhaps your
future self found an artifact of great power connecting him to the
past, which he must now lead you to discover, or perhaps he was
taught the mystic arts by his future self long ago, and you will
have to continue this cycle by teaching yourself someday. You
future self has forgotten the fine details of some things, and
outright refuses to tell you about things you "can't know yet", but
nonetheless offers compelling insight and guidance. You're not
quite sure what he is planning for your future (and his past), but
one thing is certain- he needs you alive.
Future Self Quirks
Strange effects linger as a result of communicating with your
future self. You gain one of the following traits.
d6 Quirk
1 You often speak in the wrong tense.
2 You sometimes refer to a person you've just met by
name, before they've introduced themselves.
3 You often refer to yourself in the plural.
4 In certain lighting, you look much older than you are.
5 Seeing certain people alive and unharmed can instantly
reduce you to tears.
6 Your futuristic fashion sense completely clashes with the
fashion of today.
Expanded Spell List
Your future self lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to
the warlock spell list for you.
Future Self Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Shield, Detect Magic
2nd Locate Object, Misty Step
3rd Gaseous Form, Protection from Enemy
4th Death Ward, Divination
5th Legend Lore, Mislead
It Happened Like This
Starting at 1st level, your discussions of the future with yourself
have given you some periphery knowledge of how events played
out. When you take a short or long rest, your DM rolls a d20 in
secret and records the number rolled.
You DM may choose to disclose the value, keep it a secret, or
lie about its value. You can replace any ability check you make
with this roll. You may do so after you make the roll, but must do
so before it is determined whether the roll succeeds or fails. You
can only use this recorded value once.
I Could do With Fewer Scars
At 6th level, your future self often warns you of particular attacks
to watch out for. When you are targeted by an attack, you can
impose disadvantage on the roll. You can use this ability a
number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per short or
long rest.
Expect an Ambush
At 10th level, your future self always warns you about potential
ambushes. AS a result, you cannot be surprised while you are
conscious and you have advantage on initiative rolls.
Time Remnant
Once you reach 14th level, your future self fights by your side for
a short time when the situation calls for it. You gain the effects of
the Haste spell for one minute, and can cast any spells with a
range of touch within 5 feet of yourself or your future self, who
moves on their own.
You can use this ability once per short or long rest.
The Ghost in the Machine (UA)
You have made a bargain for power granted by an entity that you
believe to be completely digital. Whether it is a rogue AI or the
spirit of a deceased hacker, the Ghost in the Machine is capable of
technological feats that defy explanation.
Epanded Spell List
The Ghost in the Machine lets you choose from an expanded list
of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are
added to the warlock spell list for you.
Ghost in the Machine Expanded Spells

4th Conjure Knowbot, System Backdoor
5th Shutdown, Syncronicity
Bonus Proficiency
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking tools.
Information Surge
At 1st level, you gain the ability to temporarily render
computerized devices inoperable. As an action, you can target a
computerized device within 30 feet of you. If the targeted device
is held or otherwise actively used by a living creature, the
creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a failed save, the targeted device ceases to
function until the end of your next turn. If the targeted device is
not held or used by a creature, the DM makes a special saving
throw for the device with disadvantage and a +0 modifier. Certain
shielded devices might negate the disadvantage, at the DM's
discretion.
Wire Walk
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to travel short distances
over electrical wires, data lines, or telephone cables. As a bonus
action, you can touch a device or socket connected to a hardwired
network and teleport along this network to another device or
socket within your line of sight. Once you use this feature, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Personal Encryption
Beginning at 10th level, you have learned to apply innate
knowledge of encryption to your thoughts, memories, and
presence. You have advantage on saving throws against scrying,
thought detection, or any other method of magically learning your
wherabouts or reading your thoughts. For any such effect that
does not grant you a saving throw but does require the creature
targeting you to make an ability check, the check is made with
disadvantage.
Technovirus
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's body
with living circuitry. You can use an action to make a melee
attack against a humanoid creature using your spell attack
modifier. The target must make a Constitution saving throw
against your Spell Save DC as a technorganic cirus spreads
quickly through its body. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10
psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Additionally, if the target fails its saving throw, you can use an
action to issue it a single command, as if you were casting the
Command spell. The target makes its saving throw against your
command with disadvantage. You can issue this command at any
time while the target remains infected.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a long rest, at which point the target is cured of the technovirus.
The infection can also be removed with a Lesser Restoration
spell.
The Great Old One (PHB)
Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign
to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the
space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known
only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and
its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest
libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great
Old One might be unaware of your existence or entirely
indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to
draw your magic from it.
Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which
Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent;
Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; and other unfathomable
beings.
Expanded Spell List
The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are
added to the warlock spell list for you.
Great Old One Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Dissonant Whispers, Tasha's Hideous Laughter
2nd Detect Thoughts, Phantasmal Force
3rd Clairvoyance, Sending
4th Dominate Beast, Evard's Black Tentacles
5th Dominate Person, Telekinesis
Awakened Mind
Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to
touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate
telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to
understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be
able to understand at least one language.
Entropic Ward
At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack
and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself.
When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use
your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack
misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has
advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.
Thought Shield
Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or
other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to
psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage
to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you
do.
Create Thrall
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind
with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to
touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed
by you until a Remove Curse spell is cast on it, the charmed
condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again.
You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature
as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
The Hexblade (XGE)
You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the
Shadowfell – a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons
carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is
the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread
across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind
these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with
it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those
formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to
weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.
Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of
these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are
one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools
she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her
inscrutable ends.
Hexblade Quirks
d8 Quirk
1
While you're bonded with your weapon, you can
occasionally hear the voice of the creator or a previous
owner emanate from it.
2
Minor visual or other sensory effects change or appear on
your weapon, causing it to change color, design,
ornamentation, sound, smell, or general condition.
3
Any small damages and bloodstains magically repair and
clean themselves from you and your weapon as soon as
they are made. This does not restore health.
4
While wielding your weapon, strange runes, symbols, or
tattoos appear on your body, only to disappear once it
leaves your grasp.
5 You feel naked, uncomfortable, deeply emotional, or
utterly emotionless without your weapon on your person.
6
Your magic becomes unstable or erratic when your
weapon is not on your person. This has no mechanical
effect, but your character may be unwilling to cast spells
without their blade, or it may look strange.
7
You randomly hallucinate strange images of horrific
bloody combat either when wielding your weapon or
when it's not on your person, and believe they may be
battles your blade was involved in.
8
Your hair, skin, or eyes shift color at a nauseating pace
either when wielding your weapon or when it's not on
your person (your choice), stabilizing in whatever color
they happen to be when you draw or stow your weapon.
Expanded Spell List
The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to
the warlock spell list for you.
Hexblade Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Shield, Wrathful Smite
2nd Blur, Branding Smite
3rd Blink, Elemental Weapon
4th Phantasmal Killer, Staggering Smite
5th Banishing Smite, Cone of Cold
Hexblade's Curse
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse
on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see
within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse
ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated.
Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
• You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target.
The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
• Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical
hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
• If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your
warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit
point).
You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long
rest.
Hex Warrior
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm
yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor,
shields, and martial weapons.
The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically
channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you
finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are
proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you
attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier,
instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the
Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact
weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's
type.
Accursed Specter
Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay,
temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a
humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a
specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points
equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter,
which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it
gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of +0).
The specter remains in your service until the end of your next
long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.
Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the
feature again until you finish a long rest.
Armor of Hexes
At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed
by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, roll a d6.
On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its
roll.
Master of Hexes
Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from
a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by
your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different
creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't
incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't
regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.
The Keeper of the Depths (H)
You've made a pact with an ancient, oceanic entity known as the
Keeper of the Depths. As life teems within the seas, so do the
secrets of the forgotten ages - sunken cities, ships lost at sea, and
treasures unimaginable gone to the darkest currents that churn
with horrible tentacles and creatures from nightmare. The Keeper
watches over all of these, and guides them in its endless pursuit of
knowledge. In the deepest crevices where sunlight has never been
seen, all oceans are one to the Keeper of the Depths, and its desire
is insatiable.
Expanded Spell List
The Keeper of the Depths lets you choose from an expanded list
of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are
added to the warlock spell list for you.
Keeper of the Depths Expanded Spells
| Warlock Level | Spells | | 1st | Identify | | 3rd | Zone of Truth | 5th
| Tidal Wave | | 7th | Watery Sphere | | 9th | Maelstrom |
Secrets of the Depths
Starting at 1st level, your patron visits you in your dreams,
learning what you've learned in exchange for hidden knowledge.
Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain proficiency in two
skills, languages, or tools of your choice. You remain proficient in
these until you finish another long rest, at which point you can
choose new ones to replace them.
Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your movement
speed.
Strange Aeons
At 6th level, the Keeper shares the secret of false immortality
with you. Whenever you have 0 hit points, you do not fall
unconcious but still must make death saving throws until you are
stabilized. However, you cannot personally take actions that
would directly result in you recovering hit points.
You can benefit from this feature once per short or long rest.
Madness of the Deep
At 10th level, your patron allows you to call on its unspeakable
secrets and inflict them on others. As an action, choose a creature
within 60 feet. The target must make an Wisdom saving throw
against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they are driven
mad, and must use their action to make a melee attack against
themselves during their turn. This lasts until they succeed a
repeated saving throw made at the end of each of their turns.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.
Consumption of Mind and Soul
At 14th level, as an action, you can summon the terrible maw of
the Keeper to appear before you. A massive beak surrounded by
tentacles appears and attempts to grab a target of your choice
within 30 feet. When a creature is targeted, it must make a
Strength saving throw against your warlock spell save DC to
shake off the grasp of the horror. If the target fails it is dragged
into the beak and bitten, taking 6d10 piercing damage and 6d10
psychic damage. If this is enough to reduce the the target to 0 hit
points, you can choose to have them be swallowed whole by the
mouth, consuming them. Either way, the maw then immediately
disappears. You can summon the maw once per long rest.
If you have a creature eaten using this feature, your patron
visits you in your dreams during your next long rest and grants
you a boon in return for the sacrifice. Choose any spell of 5th
level or lower. You can cast this spell once using a warlock spell
slot. If you do not cast this spell before killing another creature
with this ability and resting, it is lost.
The Legion of Spirits (H)
Spirit Barrage
Starting at 1st level, the damage type of your Eldritch blasts
becomes necrotic, and they deal an additional 1d4 cold damage.
Haunt
Starting at 6th level, you conjure spirits to torment your enemy.
You may order your spirits to target a creature within 60 feet. The
creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be tormented by
the spirits. While your spirits torment this creature, they are under
the effect of Hunter’s Mark and have disadvantage on
Concentration saving throws and cannot benefit from rests,
though taking a long rest allows them to re-roll the saving throw.
Your spirits last for up to a number of days equal to your
Charisma modifier, until the creature makes the save, or until you
use this ability again. This ability also ends if the target of your
ability is the target of the remove curse spell.
Spirit Walk
Starting at 10th level, you gain the ability to become ethereal for
a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. You are
treated as if you are under the effects of the Etherealness spell for
the duration. This ability can be used once per short or long rest.
Ethereal Legion
Starting at 14th level, your connection with the spirits becomes
strong enough to allow them to affect this world. Once per long
rest, you can use this ability to create an aura in a 30 ft sphere
around you that lasts 1 minute. Any number of creatures you
choose within the area must make a WIS saving throw (against
your spell DC) immediately and at the beginning of each turn
they begin inside the area. On a failed save, they take 5d8 psychic
damage and come under the effects of your choice of either the
slow spell or the Enemies abound spell (chosen when you use the
ability); on a success, they are not affected by either spell and
take half damage. If a creature leaves the radius, the spell effect
on them ends.
The Library (H)
Extended Spell List
The Library lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.
The Library Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Guiding Bolt, Identify
2nd Locate Object, Silence
3rd Clairvoyance, Tongues
4th Divination, Leomund's Secret Chest
5th Geas, Legend Lore
Library Card
Starting at 1st level, you use your Charisma modifier for all
Intelligence-based skills, and you may gain advantage on any
intelligence-based check if you spend at least ten minutes
perusing the extradimensional library with which you’ve made
your pact. The library can be accessed from any location, but you
must remain in one place while using this ability.
Background Check
Starting at 6th level, you can search the library for a person’s
recent history. This can be done once per long rest and takes an
action to do. When you do this you gain insight on the past 24
hours of the person’s life, as if you had lived them yourself.
Know Your Enemy
At 10th level, you may use your bond with the Library to glean
tactical information relevant to your pursuits. During your short
rest, you may commune with the library to gain information about
your foes. Select a race to gain knowledge of. You gain advantage
on History and Nature checks about your chosen enemy, and
resistance to a related damage type of your choice, excluding
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
Limitless
Starting at 14th level, you have mastered the secret knowledge of
the library, expanding your ability to learn and travel. You gain
the following benefits:
You gain access to another class’s spell list of your choice.
You can replace any or all spells you know with spells from
that list, including your Mystic Arcanum spells. Spells
replaced in this way must be of equivalent level.
You can cast Teleport targeting only yourself. Teleport,
when cast this way, can be used to go to other planes of
existence as well. This can be done twice per long rest.
The Raven Queen (UA)
You patron is the Raven Queen, a mysterious being who rules the
Shadowfell from a palace of ice deep within that dread realm. The
Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature’s
death and ensuring that it meets its end at the proscribed time and
place. As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed,
dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is
limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will.
Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers
from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning
them of impending dangers.
The Raven Queen’s followers are expected to serve her will in
the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to
die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat
those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations
of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her
followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as
skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons
in her eyes.
Expanded Spell List
The Raven Queen lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to
the warlock spell list for you.
Raven Queen Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells

5th Commune, Cone of Cold
Sentinel Raven
Starting at 1st level, you gain the service of a spirit sent by the
Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and
game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands,
which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of
you.While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain
darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive
Wisdom (Perception) score and to Wisdom (Perception) checks.
The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your
shoulder, the raven can’t be targeted by any attack or other
harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can’t take
damage; and it is incapacitated.
You can see through the raven’s eyes and hear what it hears
while it is within 100 feet of you.
In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it
acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack
rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.
The raven doesn’t require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of
you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action.
The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you
are separated by more than 5 miles. At the end of a short or long
rest, you can call the raven back to you— no matter where it is or
whether it died— and it reappears within 5 feet of you.
Soul of the Raven
At 6th level, you gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit.
As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder,
your body merges with your raven’s form. While merged, you
become Tiny, you replace your speed with the raven’s, and you
can use your action only to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide,
or Search. During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven
being perched on your shoulder. As an action, you and the raven
return to normal.
Raven’s Shield
At 10th level, the Raven Queen grants you a protective blessing.
You gain advantage on death saving throws, immunity to the
frightened condition, and resistance to necrotic damage.
Queen’s Right Hand
Starting at 14th level, you can channel the Raven Queen’s power
to slay a creature. You can cast finger of death. After you cast the
spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a
long rest.
The Seeker (UA)
Your patron is an inscrutable being who travels the Astral Plane in
search of knowledge and secrets. In return for your patron’s gifts,
you wander the world seeking lore that you can share with the
Seeker.
Your patron could be any deity or other powerful entity
dedicated to knowledge or forgotten lore. Celestian is an ideal
patron for a Greyhawk campaign, and was the inspiration for this
concept. In the Forgotten Realms, your patron might be Azuth or
Oghma. Aureon makes an excellent patron in Eberron, while in
Krynn and the Dragonlance campaign setting, Gilean is a good
match for the Seeker’s role.
Expanded Spell List
The Seeker lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.
Seeker Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st Feather Fall, Jump

Shielding Aurora
Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the Seeker’s power to protect
you from harm. As a bonus action, you create a whirling aurora of
brilliant energy that swirls around you. Until the end of your next
turn, you gain resistance to all damage, and if a hostile creature
ends its turn within 10 feet of you, it takes radiant damage equal
to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
Astral Refuge
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step into an astral refuge. As
an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and
enter the Astral Plane, taking advantage of its timeless nature.
While in your astral refuge, you can take two actions to cast
spells that target only you. After using those two actions, you
return to the space you occupied and your turn ends.
Far Wanderer
At 10th level, you no longer need to breathe, and you gain
resistance to fire damage and cold damage.
Astral Sequestration
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to sequester yourself
and your allies on the Astral Plane.
By performing a special ritual over the course of 5 minutes,
you shift yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see to
the Astral Plane. You and those creatures gain the benefits of a
short rest while sequestered on the Astral Plane. You then return
to the spaces you all occupied when you used this ability, with no
time having passed in the world.
During this short rest, you and the creatures you sequester can
make use of any options available during a rest that affect only
you and the creatures you sequester.
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you
complete a long rest.

Unformed Beasts
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to summon a zombie-like
beast. It uses the statistics of a normal wolf, with the following
exceptions:
It uses your Spell Attack bonus for its attacks instead of its
own.
It acts on your turn, retaining its own movement and bonus
action, but using your action to attack.
You can summon or dismiss your Unformed beasts as a
bonus action
It gains an additional type of attack that you can order it to
make as follows:
Sacrifice: Your beast uses a free dash action to move into
a group of enemies you command it toward within range,
then self-destructs in an 5-foot radius explosion centered
on the beast. All creatures within this radius must make a
Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to 1d4 + the remaining HP of your beast, or half as much damage on a
successful save.
If a beast is sacrificed in this way, you cannot re-summon it
until your next short rest. You may only have one beast active at a
time until 5th level, at which point you may have two. This
increases to 3 at 11th level, and 4 at 20th.
Voodoo Doll
Starting at 6th level, when you sacrifice an Unformed Beast, you
may expend a bonus action to write the name or description of
your target on a voodoo doll that you’ve made to inflict one of the
following conditions of your choice on the target for a number of
rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The target
may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the effects of this
curse when the attack is made.
Condition Choices
Blinded
Deafened
Paralyzed
Poisoned
Restrained
Stunned
Unformed Land
Starting at 10th level, you gain the ability to receive knowledge in
return for the mana within your beasts. When you sacrifice an
Unformed Beast, you may cast Divination, Scrying, or True
Seeing without expending a spell slot. Once you use this ability
with one of these spells, you must complete a short or long rest
before you can use it again.
Shadowman’s Chosen
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to invite the
Shadowman into your body by performing a ritualistic dance.
Make a Performance check. For the next minute, you gain the

saving throw during the duration, you can
instead choose not to fail.
31-35
You gain benefits of 11-30, and enemies are
treated as vulnerable to damage you and your
Unformed Beasts deal for the duration.
The Undying (SCAG)
Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the
secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize- like all powercomes
at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal
lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and
nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and
death.
Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the
Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of
Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless
wizard Fistandantalus. In the Realms, Undying patrons include
Larloch the Shadow King, legendary master of Warlock's Crypt,
and Gilgeam, the God-King of Unther.
Expanded Spell List
The Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of spells
when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to
the warlock spell list for you.
Undying Expanded Spells
Spell Level Spells
1st False Life, Ray of Sickness
2nd Blindness/Deafness, Silence
3rd Feign Death, Speak With Dead
4th Aura of Life, Death Ward
5th Contagion, Legend Lore
Among the Dead
Starting at 1st level, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which
counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on
saving throws against any disease.
Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead
targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature
must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC
(an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area
effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the
creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone
instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a
successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target
it with an attack or a harmful spell.
Defy Death
Starting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when you
cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can
regain hit points equal to ld8 +your Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving
throw or when you stabilize a creature with spare the dying.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a long rest.

Undying Nature
Beginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely,
and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still
require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing
short and long rests.
In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that
pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being
magically aged.
Indestructible Life
When you reach 14th level, you partake of some of the true
secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use a bonus action
to regain hit points equal to ld8 + your warlock level.
Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in
place when you use this feature, the part reattaches.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.
